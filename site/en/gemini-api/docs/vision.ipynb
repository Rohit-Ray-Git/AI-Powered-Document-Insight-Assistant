This might involve miniature boilers, valves, and nozzles, likely using lightweight, heat-resistant metals like titanium or specialized alloys. Precision machining and welding would be essential.\n    * **Steam Generation:** A compact, lightweight steam generator would be needed. This could involve a miniaturized boiler heated by a powerful, compact energy source (perhaps a high-density battery, though not explicitly mentioned in the drawing). This requires expertise in thermodynamics, materials science, and miniaturization.\n    * **Control System:**  A system of valves and controls (possibly electronic) would regulate steam flow to the boosters for controlled thrust. This involves electronics manufacturing and software development for the control system.\n\n3. **Power Source Production:**  If using batteries, a specialized battery manufacturing process would be required for high energy density and rapid discharge capabilities.\n\n4. **Assembly and Testing:**\n    * **Integration:**  The backpack and jetpack components would be carefully integrated and secured. This would involve fitting the steam generator, boosters, and control system within the backpack structure while maintaining balance and user comfort.\n    * **Quality Control:**  Rigorous testing would be essential. This would include pressure tests for the steam system, thrust tests for the boosters, flight stability tests, and safety checks for the entire system.  Given the nature of a jetpack, certification and regulatory compliance would be critical before market release.\n\n5. **USB-C Charging System Integration:**  Standard USB-C charging ports and circuitry would be integrated for charging the power source (presumably the battery that powers the steam generator).\n\nThis is a simplified overview. A real-world jetpack backpack would require much more complex engineering and manufacturing processes. The steam-powered aspect adds further complexity, as steam power is not typically used for personal flight devices due to efficiency and safety concerns.\n"

It’s made of the same elements as stars but never became massive enough to ignite. It’s comprised mostly of swirled gases and liquids and its iconic feature, the Great Red Spot, is a giant, centuries-old storm.  \n\nScientists have noticed that the Great Red Spot is evolving. The spot’s color is deepening, and it is shrinking and becoming more circular. These scientists theorized that as the storm shrinks, the wind speeds should increase, like a spinning ice skater who pulls in her arms. \n\nHowever, recent data shows that the spot isn’t rotating faster, it’s getting taller. The change is analogous to the way clay spins as it is molded on a potter’s wheel. Although it’s shrinking horizontally, the spot is increasing vertically.  \n\nThe Great Red Spot used to be large enough to hold three Earths, but it’s now just a little bigger than one. The data is based on analyses from NASA missions like Voyager, Hubble, and Juno. Scientists are hopeful that further investigation will reveal more secrets of the mysterious Great Red Spot.\n\n\nQuiz:\n\n1. Which planet is considered the oldest and largest in our solar system?\nA. Mars\nB. Earth\nC. Jupiter\nD. Saturn\n\n2. What is the Great Red Spot?\nA. A gigantic volcano\nB. A giant storm\nC. A giant crater\nD. An impact zone\n\n3. What two characteristics of the Great Red Spot are changing over time?\nA. Size and shape\nB. Temperature and depth\nC. Composition and color\nD. Rotation speed and visibility\n\n4. How does the shrinking of the Great Red Spot affect its wind speed?\nA. Wind speeds increase\nB. Wind speeds decrease\nC. Wind speeds remain constant\nD. Wind speeds fluctuate randomly\n\n5. What analogy is used to explain the change in height of the Great Red Spot?\nA. A spinning top\nB. A figure skater pulling in her arms\nC. Molding clay on a potter's wheel\nD. An inflatable balloon being deflated\n\nAnswer Key:\n1. C\n2. B\n3. A\n4. C\n5. C"

Then at [00:00:19], the video displays data from 2014 to 2017 charting relative height and latitude. While the spot is shrinking, it is also growing taller. The analogy of someone working with clay on a potter’s wheel is used to explain this phenomenon. As the large lump of clay spins on the potter’s wheel, forces are pushing it upward, making it taller. Similarly, while the Great Red Spot appears to shrink from our perspective, it is also growing taller."
